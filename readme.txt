Adds a Custom Signature from MyLiveSignature at the bottom of every post.

== Description ==

LiveSig is a WordPress plug-in that automatically inserts your MyLiveSignature code after each of your WordPress posts making it seem like each post has been personally signed by you. It helps in adding that much needed "personal touch" to all your posts.

== Installation ==

Installation couldn't get any easier. Once downloaded, simply...

1. Unzip & Copy the plug-in file into your WordPress plug-ins folder.
2. Activate the plug-in from the Plug-in Manager in WordPress.
3. Visit the **Options / Settings** menu and find a new item called LiveSig. Click on that to get to the **LiveSig Options** page. Once there simply select an appropriate user, enter the corresponding MyLiveSignature code and hit **Save**.

**NOTE:** As of now, only a user whose Role permits changing of plug-in settings (namely, Administrator) can setup the signatures for individual users. The LiveSig Options page isn't available to non-admin users (Editors / Authors / Contributors).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. LiveSig hampers the way posts are displayed when the front-page contains excerpts (using the <!--more--> tag) instead of full posts. Is there a workaround? =

**Solution:** Try selecting LiveSig to display the signature in the **Individual Posts Only** mode from the settings screen. If LiveSig breaks your posts formatting, causes duplication of posts etc. this approach should work for you. I'm still trying to get to the root cause of the problem(s) and I'm afraid you'll have to live with this solution for now. 

= 2. LiveSig doesn't play well with certain other plug-ins like NextGEN gallery and breaks the page formatting. How to fix this? =

**Solution:** See No. 1
